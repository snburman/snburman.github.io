FnComponents are rendered by directing http requests through a special middleware function.
```go
func MiddleWareFn(http.HandlerFunc, fncmp.HandleFn) http.HandlerFunc
```

It's a bit of a mouth full, so let's break it down.

### http.HandlerFunc
This is the standard [http.HandlerFunc](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#HandlerFunc) that you would use in a normal http server.
This is the HandlerFunc that we'll use to serve the index file.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value={0} label="html">
        ```go title="func (http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)"
        func HandleIndex(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            http.ServeFile(w, r, "static/index.html")
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value={1} label="templ">
        ```go title="main.go"
        func HandleIndex(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            c := Index()
            c.Render(r.Context(), w)
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### fncmp.HandleFn
This is the function that will be used to handle the FnComponents within the scope of the route.
If you read the [introduction](/docs/fncmp/), you'll remember that we created a button component.

HandleMainFn receives context containing the http request, as well as information that fncmp
communicates with fncmp.min.js to render the button component. fncmp.NewFn takes this context
as well as the button component and returns a FnComponent.
```go title="func (context.Context) fncmp.FnComponent"
func HandleMainFn(ctx context.Context) fncmp.FnComponent {
    return fncmp.NewFn(ctx, button)
}
```
