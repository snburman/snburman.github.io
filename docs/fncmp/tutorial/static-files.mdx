You can use any web server you like, however the examples will be using [http.ServeMux](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ServeMux) from the standard library.

Here, we're serving the static directory that we created earlier.
```go title="main.go"
func main() {
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	// This serves html and js files
	mux.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("static")))
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mux))
}
```
